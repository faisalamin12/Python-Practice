Tuples
# Tuples is just like a list with some diffrences
# 1 List values is placed in square brackets but tuple values is placed in round brackets
?
L1 = ["apple" , 1 , "banana" , 2 ]
T1 = ("apple" , 1 ,"banana" , 1)
print("The list is: ", L1)
print("The tuple is: ", T1)
The list is:  ['apple', 1, 'banana', 2]
The tuple is:  ('apple', 1, 'banana', 1)
 5 times because I run this cell 5 times
# The major diffrence between List and tuples are List are Mutable means its value can be changed
# Tuples are imutable means its value can not be changed means no adding values no removing
L1.append("car")
L1
?
# append("car")
?
# It generates error because it doesnot allow to add any value
# It generates value "car" 5 times because I run this cell 5 times
['apple', 1, 'banana', 2, 'car', 'car', 'car', 'car', 'car', 'car']
For Loop
lly iterated
# Loop is a iterative process means it can perform same thing many  times
?

?
for x in c:
    print(x)
    
    # For every itelration a single value of list is transer to x and then print it runs untill the list is totally iterated
