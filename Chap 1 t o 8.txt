Variables
# Variable is aplace in which you can store any value either integer or string
# Some Rules for naming variables
?
# 1. No spaces between them

Concatenating Text Strings
# In math operation the + aperator is used to add to numbers
# but an another use of + operator is to cocatenate two text strings
a = 2
b = 2
print(a + b)

a = "faisal "
b = "amin"
print(a + b)
faisal amin
a = "2"
b = "2"
print(a + b)
?
# its answer is 22 because the value 2 is in qoutation and it brhaves like a text string and + operaror concatenate them
22
