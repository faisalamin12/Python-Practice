What is list
# if we want to define more than one variable we define multiple variable at at time
# But python give us another way to define mutiple values in a single variable
# This type of variable is called list
?
# how to initialize list:
?
# listName = [values]
?
names = ["faisal" , " hammad" , "amin"]
print(names)
['faisal', ' hammad', 'amin']
0
# Index number is address of a value just like your home address your house is value and your flat number is address
# same way value has an address in list
# we can also print a value by an index number
?
?
names = ["faisal" , " hammad" , "amin"]
print(names[0])
faisal
Adding values in list
append , insert

# in append function value is added at the end of the list
cities = ["karachi" , "lahore" , "islamabad"]
cities.append("pehswar")
print(cities)
['karachi', 'lahore', 'islamabad', 'pehswar']
#in insert function we need to pass 2 arguments one is index number and the other is value it add the value at the
# particular index'''
cities = ["karachi" , "lahore" , "islamabad"]
cities.insert(2,"quetta")
print(cities[2])
?
quetta
Deleting values from list
.reomove()
del listname[index number]
#if you want to delete value through index number you can use del keyword
cities = ["karachi" , "lahore" , "islamabad"]
del cities[1]
print(cities)
?
# You can see that the value in index 1 is deleted
?
['karachi', 'islamabad']
# if you want to delete value by define value you can use remove function it finds the index unmber and delete the value
cities = ["karachi" , "lahore" , "islamabad"]
cities.remove("lahore")
print(cities)
['karachi', 'islamabad']
Delete value By pop()
cities = ["karachi" , "lahore" , "islamabad"]
# pop function return the delete value from the list and it accepts index number as argument
?
cities = ["karachi" , "lahore" , "islamabad"]
city_removed = cities.pop(1)
print(cities)
['karachi', 'islamabad']
Slicing the values in list
]
# Slice is a fuction that copies the values of list and insert it in anaother list it accepts two index numbers as arguments
cities = ["karachi" , "lahore" , "islamabad"]
slicing_cities =  cities[0:2]
print(slicing_cities)
['karachi', 'lahore']
Small application of slicing the values
ages = [12, 13, 15 , 17 , 20 , 25]
?
firstIndex= int(input("from which index you want to copy: "))
secondIndex= int(input("from which index till you want to copy:"))
?
slicing_values= ages[firstIndex:secondIndex+1]
print(slicing_values)
?
print("orignal list is: ",ages)
print("copied value",slicing_values)
                
from which index you want to copy: 2
from which index till you want to copy:4
[15, 17, 20]
orignal list is:  [12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 25]
copied value [15, 17, 20]
